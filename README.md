WeWork is a crowdsourcing platform for individuals to find work or post a job and find workers. WeWork has a coin-based system which allows you to pay an individual in coins for your work, and the balance can be replenished by working for someone else. Through this marketplace, individuals can find short term or time-based employment for on-demand services. The work ranges from small household services, repairs, fixtures to personal services. Be it getting a plumbing job done, improving your fitness through yoga, learning to play the guitar, decorating your home or getting candid photos of your wedding clicked, we are a sure shot destination for your service needs.
